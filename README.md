## 1. `homoplastic_score.R`

### Purpose
Calculates homoplasy metrics (extra steps, consistency index, homoplasy slope, homoplasy slope ratio) for a given mutation across a phylogeny. Used to identify convergent (homoplastic) mutations in the context of the core SNP phylogeny of *S. aureus*.

### Dependencies
- **R (≥ 3.x)**
- R packages:
  - **phangorn** (phylogenetic analysis)
  - **ape** (phylogenetic tree reading)
  - **argparser** (argument parsing)
- **sgrep** (sorted grep for extracting mutation IDs)

### Usage
```bash
Rscript homoplastic_score.R <tree> <mutation_db> <mutation_id> [--nsims N] [--avg_hs VAL]
```

**Arguments:**
- `tree`: Path to the phylogenetic tree in Newick format (e.g., from RAxML).
- `mutation_db`: Sorted mutation database file (first column must be mutation ID).
- `mutation_id`: Mutation ID to analyze.
- `--nsims`: (Optional) Number of simulations for average homoplasy slope calculation (default: 100).
- `--avg_hs`: (Optional) Skip simulation and use this value as average homoplasy slope.

### Output
Tab-delimited metrics: mutation count, number of convergent acquisitions, consistency index, homoplasy slope, average homoplasy slope, homoplasy slope ratio.

### Methods Reference
Used to assign number of convergent acquisitions to variants across 7,099 *S. aureus* genomes, as described in the Convergence analysis and CMAS calculation section.

## 2. `sample_run_gubbins.sh`

### Purpose
Runs Gubbins recombination detection on multiple random subsamples of a whole-genome alignment. Facilitates robust estimation of recombination rates at each genome position by repeated sampling.

### Dependencies
- **bash** (Unix shell)
- **awk** (text processing)
- **shuf** (randomization)
- **head** (text processing)
- **cat** (text processing)
- **run_gubbins.py** (Gubbins, v2.4.1+)
- **seq** (sequence generation; coreutils)

### Usage
```bash
bash sample_run_gubbins.sh
```
**Variables (set at the top):**
- `FA_TO_SAMPLE`: Path to the full core alignment FASTA (default: `../../core.full.aln`).
- `N_SAMPLE`: Number of subsampled runs (default: 100).
- `SIZE_SAMPLE`: Number of genomes per subsample (default: 100).
- `MIN_SNPS`: Minimum SNPs for Gubbins run (default: 10).

### Output
Generates multiple Gubbins output files (`gubbins.samp...`), each corresponding to a different random subset.

### Methods Reference
Described under Convergence analysis and CMAS calculation. Recombination was estimated for every genome position by running gubbins 8 times on subsampled phylogenetic trees.

## 3. `get_gap_ambiguous_snp_score.sh`

### Purpose
Calculates the percentage of gaps, ambiguous bases, and SNPs at every position in a full genome alignment, generating userplot files for visualization. Used to filter out low-confidence positions prior to CMAS calculation.

### Dependencies
- **bash** (Unix shell)
- **trimal** (v1.4 or later; sequence alignment trimming and stats)
- **sed** (stream editor)
- **awk** (text processing)
- **grep** (text search)
- **cut** (text processing)
- **rm** (file removal)

### Usage
```bash
bash get_gap_ambiguous_snp_score.sh <alignment>
```
- `<alignment>`: Core genome alignment file (output from snippy).

### Output
Creates several files:
- `${aln}.pct_gap`, `${aln}.pct_gap_ambiguous`, `${aln}.pct_ambiguous`, `${aln}.pct_snp`: Tabular files with per-position stats.
- `.userplot` files: Int format, compatible with Artemis for plotting.
- Cleans up intermediate files.

### Methods Reference
Used as described in Convergence analysis and CMAS calculation to determine the percentage of ambiguous and gap calls at every position.

## 4. `rmseq_SSR_count.sh`

### Purpose
Counts the frequency of SSR (simple sequence repeat) lengths in amplicon sequencing data generated by RM-seq, focusing on specific SSR patterns. Outputs a table of counts for each SSR length and sample.

### Dependencies
- **bash** (Unix shell)
- **cut** (text processing)
- **grep** (text search)
- **wc** (word/line counting)
- **tail** (text processing)
- **echo** (text output)

### Usage
```bash
bash rmseq_SSR_count.sh <file1> [<file2> ...]
```
- `<file>`: RM-seq amplicon effect file(s) to process.

### Output
Tabulated summary:
- Columns: sample name, counts for each SSR length (10A, 9A, ..., 5A), total count.

### Methods Reference
Used in RM-seq amplicon deep-sequencing of SSR loci to count and compare SSR lengths across samples.

## 5. `hetero_SSR_call.sh`

### Purpose
Identifies SSR (simple sequence repeat) variant subpopulations in sequence data from human-derived samples. Maps reads, calculates coverage, prepares BAMs for low-frequency variant calling with LoFreq, and normalizes indel calls.

### Dependencies
- **bash** (Unix shell)
- **bwa** (read mapper)
- **samtools** (v1.10+; BAM handling, coverage stats)
- **lofreq** (v2.1.2+; low-frequency variant caller)
- **vcfallelicprimitives** (vcflib; VCF normalization)
- **awk** (text processing)
- **cut** (text processing)
- **basename** (coreutils)

### Usage
```bash
bash hetero_SSR_call.sh <reference_fasta> <sample_R1.fastq> <sample_R2.fastq>
```
- `<reference_fasta>`: Reference genome (e.g., *S. aureus* NRS384).
- `<sample_R1.fastq>`: Forward reads.
- `<sample_R2.fastq>`: Reverse reads.

### Output
- `${sample}.bam`: Sorted BAM.
- `${sample}_coverage_mean_std.tsv`, `${sample}_coverage.tsv`: Coverage stats.
- `${sample}_lofreq2_allelicprimitives.vcf`: Normalized VCF of low-frequency variants.

### Methods Reference
Described in Identification of SSR variants subpopulations in human derived samples. Automates mapping, LoFreq calling, and variant filtering pipeline.

These scripts are integrated at multiple points in the study’s pipeline:
- Homoplasy and convergence analysis (`homoplastic_score.R`) builds directly on variant calls and phylogenetic trees.
- Recombination filtering (`sample_run_gubbins.sh`) and alignment quality checks (`get_gap_ambiguous_snp_score.sh`) ensure high-confidence positions for CMAS analyses.
- SSR quantification (`rmseq_SSR_count.sh` and `hetero_SSR_call.sh`) enables exploration of SSR variation from amplicon (RM-seq) and shotgun metagenomic data.

Please see the Methods section of the manuscript for more context and rationale for each script’s use.
